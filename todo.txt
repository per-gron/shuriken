Differences from Ninja:
* Dependencies of builds steps that have been run are deduced from the files that the build
  step read instead of relying on the information in the manifest. (mscv_deps_prefix, deps
  and depfile are ignored, other than that the .d file is removed)
* File hashes are used rather than mtimes (except for generator rules, they still use mtimes)
* msvc_deps_prefix, deps, depfile are unnecessary (except that the .d file should be removed)
* Supports multiple outputs even when deps is specified
* When the console pool is used, the command is always rebuilt. Reason being
  stdin is not a deterministic source, and it tends to be used for things as tests
  and generator rules anyway.

Missing features:
* spell checking on target file names
* browse
* urtle

Build steps in Shuriken must fulfill the following requirements:
* Must be a pure function; given the same input must generate the same output
* The output must be written only as files and output to stdin/stderr
* The input must be read only from the file system, from the command line and from
  environment variables. This means that input must not come from stdin, network, other
  processes, devices etc. Ideally it should also not depend on time or randomness.
* Must not modify input files. This also includes that input files must not be moved.
  (Every file that the build step did not create is an input file.)
* When inputs are outputs of other build steps, those must be declared as dependencies.
* When the command of the build step returns, all of the processes it created must be dead.


The manifest must fulfill the following requirements:
* There must not be more than one build step that generates any given output file
* All input files except for phony inputs must exist
* No cyclic dependencies


Steps of a Shuriken build:
* Read the manifest file, build Manifest graph, which contains
  - All build steps:
    - Other build steps that (order-only) depend on this build step
    - Command line invocation
    - bool restat
* Read the invocation log, which contains
  - All build invocations that have been successfully run:
    - Output files fingerprints
    - Inputs (fingerprints, but also make sure to handle the access syscall)
    - (Hash of) the build step that the invocation is based on

* Find build invocations that no longer exist in the Manifest graph
  - Remove the outputs
* Find build invocations that are dirty
  - Verify input and output fingerprints
* Find build steps that have no corresponding build invocation

* Construct Tasks graph:
  - From dirty invocations and build steps that don't have an invocation
  - Each task contains
    - Command line invocation
    - Output file fingerprints of prior build invocation (if any)
    - bool restat
    - Other tasks that depend on this one
    - The number of tasks that this task depends on
      - Decremented if a restat task changes nothing
      - The command is not run if the number is zero

* Execute Tasks graph:
  - Invoke commands in parallel
    - Restrict env vars
  - Lint
    - Check that there are no files that are generated by more than one invocation (lint the manifest)
    - Check that there are no cyclic dependencies in the manifest
    - Check that all input files except for phony targets exist
    - File system access
      - Do not read outputs
      - Do not modify inputs (move or change contents)
      - Input files that are outputs of other build invocations are
        declared as dependencies. (How to do this efficiently?)
      - Declared outputs that other rules depend on as inputs are created
      - No outputs that other build steps have already created are created
      - No outputs that other build steps have as declared outputs are created
    - Disallowed syscalls
    - Detect and reject daemons
  - When a command is done
    - delete stale outputs
    - record data in the invocation log

* Try reduce number of /bin/sh invocations per command. I think it's 3 now
* Path stuff
  - normalization of paths
  - case (in)sensitivity?
    http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-2050.18.24/bsd/hfs/hfs_vfsutils.c?txt
  - perhaps ditch canonicalization and use st_dev/st_ino instead.
- Fingerprint stuff
* Hashing function
* Functionality to parse and write to the invocation log
- Function to delete outputs
* Function to detect insufficiently declared dependencies (how to do this?)

Path:
* Is a (st_ino, st_dev) tuple + canonicalized path under it (interned)
* A path can be 1 machine word, if the interned string also has the stat data
* Canonicalization consists of both normalizing .. and . and //s and canonicalizing
  + case folding the string itself.
* All directories within the canonicalized path must be real directories, not symlinks
* Need to detect and fail on directories that would have been created to do the
  build that are hard links to each other.
* Things to make sure
  - No two Paths that case fold/normalize to the same path but have different non
    case folded/normalized representations.
  - Keep a map from (st_dev, st_ino) => Path. Whenever a directory is created because
    it was missing when the build started, and it turns out that it has already been
    created by someone else, make sure that its (st_dev, st_ino) is not the same as
    some other path that we have seen. That means hardlink and could break the build.

Large things remaining to do:
- Basic code structure
- Manifest parsing
- Command running
- Command tracing
- Improved path handling
- Fingerprint code
* The actual build algorithm
* Stat cache for use by Paths
* Rebuild manifest
* Limit parallelism / max load average
* Dry runs
* Invocation log
* There seems to be a race in TracingCommandRunner. It doesn't always catch deps
* BuildStatus
* CLI tools:
  * deps
  * clean
  * commands
  * graph (graphviz)
  * query
  * targets
  * compdb
  * recompact
* Shield commands from env vars
* Caching
* Distributed caching

* Write documentation
* Path case folding
* See if adding HAVE_SSSE3, HAVE_XOP, HAVE_SSE41 etc flags for blake2 makes sense
* Check test coverage and add missing unit tests

To fill in the first test:
* Generate actual DAG in gen::buildInput
* Add assertions to the property

Steal directly from Ninja:
* Stat cache for Windows
* getopt (for Windows only)
* deps_log (refactor into invocation log)
